# Code for analyzing ecological multilayer networks

This repository contains a (hopefully growing) set of algorithms to analyze multilayer ecological networks.

## NEE 2017 / Modularity

This is a collection of R code and of Matlab functions used to analyze the networks in the publication: *The Multilayer Nature of Ecological Networks*. Predominantly this is for the analysis of community detection (modularity). But also there is code for robustness analysis.

Please read the original paper **AND IT'S SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION** for details on what these functions do. Also, each code has a detailed description but if you need more details or get stuck please open an issue. This will also help others.

The code which creates the modularity matrix for bipartite networks was modified from http://netwiki.amath.unc.edu/GenLouvain/GenLouvain with help of Lucas Jeub and Mason A. Porter.

The GenLouvain code (version 2.0, 2014) was downloaded from: http://netwiki.amath.unc.edu/GenLouvain/GenLouvain on July 2016 and was not modified. Please cite this code when you use it (or parts of it). Citation:

If you want to replicate the results in the paper you should use the code with the data set in the folder **Data**
